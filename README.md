# Call Center Dashboard Project 
This is dynamic dashboard Iâ€™ve created to provide a comprehensive view of call center performance across key metrics! ðŸ“ž
## Content of Table
### Sheets Included in the Excel File
1. **Data**: Raw call center metrics and operational data.
2. **Assets**: Metadata and supporting resources such as agent lists and benchmarks.
3. **Pivots**: Summarized data using pivot tables.
4. **Call Centre Report**: Interactive dashboard and visualizations.

## Project Overview
The Call Center Dashboard Project is designed to analyze and visualize the performance of a call center, providing actionable insights to improve operations and customer satisfaction. Using Excelâ€™s tools, the project integrates raw data, assets, and summarized metrics into an interactive dashboard. This facilitates effective decision-making and performance tracking.

## Explaination

### Key features include:
- Gender Breakdown: Visual comparison of male vs. female callers by provinces.
- Call Trends: Monthly call patterns to highlight peak times and plan resources.
- Top Agents: Quick view of top-performing representatives based on calls and ratings.
- Customer Ratings & Satisfaction: Insights into customer happiness levels to drive improvements.

### Data Sheet
This sheet contains the foundational dataset with information such as:
- Call details (Call ID, duration, and status).
- Agent performance metrics.
- Customer feedback and resolution data.

### Assets Sheet
Resources essential for analysis and context:
- Agent lists and their performance benchmarks.
- Operational constraints like holiday schedules.

### Pivots Sheet
Summaries and aggregates of the data:
- Total and average calls handled per agent.
- Trends in call volumes and resolution rates.
- Analysis of escalations and their impact.

### Call Centre Report Sheet
The dashboard provides:
- Visual charts for KPIs such as customer satisfaction (CSAT), resolution rates, and call volume trends.
- Tables and leaderboards for comparing agent performance.
- Interactivity with filters and drill-down capabilities.

## Result of Project
The project successfully delivers:
- A centralized view of key metrics and insights.
- Identification of operational bottlenecks and underperforming areas.
- A tool for monitoring and improving agent and departmental performance.

## Recommendations
Based on insights:
1. Conduct targeted training for agents with low performance metrics.
2. Optimize staffing schedules during peak times to reduce wait times.
3. Enhance feedback mechanisms for actionable customer insights.
4. Improve first-call resolution protocols to boost customer satisfaction.


## Limitations
- Limited scalability: Dashboards in Excel may not handle very large datasets effectively.
- Static analysis: Updates require manual intervention unless automated workflows are implemented.
- Dependency on accurate data: Results heavily depend on the quality and completeness of input data.
