# Call-Centre-Dashboard
Introducing the ETA Call Center Dashboard!

This is dynamic dashboard Iâ€™ve created to provide a comprehensive view of call center performance across key metrics! ðŸ“ž

This dashboard visualizes real-time data for calls, revenue, customer ratings, and agent performance across multiple provinces. By breaking down metrics like call volume by region, average call ratings, and total revenue, it offers a clear and actionable view into the teamâ€™s impact.

**Key features include:**
- Gender Breakdown: Visual comparison of male vs. female callers by provinces.
- Call Trends: Monthly call patterns to highlight peak times and plan resources.
- Top Agents: Quick view of top-performing representatives based on calls and ratings.
- Customer Ratings & Satisfaction: Insights into customer happiness levels to drive improvements.

With interactive filters, this dashboard allows easy drill-down by representative or region, making it a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making. 
Iâ€™m proud of this effort to bring clarity and efficiency to call center operations!
